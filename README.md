<h3>Final Project for Ecommerce 4413@YorkU Cloud Deployment Repository</h3>

This github repository features a Java .WAR archive and Dockerfile using tomcat 9.0 as the base image for cloud deployment of Ecommerce website using service Render.com.
The site can be viewed here:

https://shelflessshop.onrender.com/Ecommerce_Project/

It might delay loading (no guarantees/patience required) as it spins down from inactivity (free service with usage + availability restrictions). 

**Docker Hub responsitory to run website using Docker:**
https://hub.docker.com/r/davzakyu/ecomproj

The database is external (AWS hosted). Therefore, there is consistency when using either docker access or render access (public URL).
