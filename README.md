<h3>Final Project for Ecommerce 4413@YorkU Cloud Deployment Repository</h3>

This github repository features a Java .WAR archive and Dockerfile using Tomcat 9.0 as the base image for cloud deployment of an ecommerce website using service Render.com.
The site can be viewed here:

https://shelflessshop.onrender.com/Ecommerce_Project/

It might delay loading (no guarantees/patience required) as it spins down from inactivity (free service with usage + availability restrictions). 
The site can alternatively be viewed using docker.

**Docker Hub responsitory to run website using Docker:**
https://hub.docker.com/r/davzakyu/ecomproj

The website database is external (AWS service). Therefore, there is consistency when using Docker or Render (public URL) access.
